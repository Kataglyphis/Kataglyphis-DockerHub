Linux image flow
----------------

The Linux container stack is intentionally split into reusable stages so BuildKit can cache stable
layers and rebuild only the slice you changed.

For the full image chain, see :doc:`Project Overview <overview>`. For local and multi-arch build
commands, see :doc:`Linux Build Basics <linux-build-basics>`.

Common development targets:

.. code-block:: bash

   nerdctl build -f linux/Dockerfile.base -t local/kataglyphis:base .
   nerdctl build -f linux/Dockerfile.toolchain -t local/kataglyphis:compiler .
   nerdctl build -f linux/Dockerfile.sdk -t local/kataglyphis:sdk .
   nerdctl build -f linux/Dockerfile.media -t local/kataglyphis:media .
   nerdctl build -f linux/Dockerfile.android -t local/kataglyphis:android .
   nerdctl build -f linux/Dockerfile.torch -t local/kataglyphis:latest .
