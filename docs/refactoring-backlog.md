Last groomed: 2026-08-31, after the A1 closure window. **The entire A1 work
section is CLOSED** (ERR-trap bug, complexity queue, modules.sh refuted) and so
is **GEN1**, which was built and wired ON. What that left open is not more
refactoring — it is **validation**: two lanes (QNN-LINUX and the new riscv64
GenAI) are wired but have never been proven by a real build, and one of them is
deliberately gate-red until that build happens.

## Standing rules (read first)

1. Never edit versions.env or the 01-core / 03-media bind-mount closure
   outside a closure window — one edit re-runs hours of media compiles.
2. Respect the protected lists (deliberate dedup, standalone bundling,
   load-bearing case arms, ARG sprawl, LiteRT-LM patch stack, SH1 retry
   semantics, SH2 non-exiting error(), DUPN2 two-pass arg mirror) —
   re-verified intentional across five sweep rounds. **modules.sh's candidate
   ORDER and its dir-walker join this list (2026-08-31, closed by refutation).**
3. Disk reclaim mid-run: prune-safe.sh → targeted rmi of pushed tags →
   NEVER system/image prune while a chain runs (removes TAGGED locals).
   SHARPENED 2026-08-21: `nerdctl system prune` ALSO wipes the buildkit
   store INCLUDING exec.cachemount records (35→1 observed) — even with no
   chain running it costs the compile caches. It is the last-resort hammer
   ONLY; prune-safe + rmi + kata-buildcache/archive-log trims come first.
4. Per-arch out/build-logs/*.log persist across runs — mtime-check before
   re-arming watchers.
5. **A test that cannot fail is worse than no test.** Two 2026-08-31 findings
   were gates that looked green while proving nothing (see the archive: the
   ugrep `--`-as-option bug, and `rc==1` passing for the wrong reason). When you
   add a regression test, MUTATE the thing it guards and confirm the test goes
   red. State in the header exactly what is and is not covered.

## A. Needs a real BUILD to close (not more code)

### A1. GEN1 validation — the riscv64 GenAI lane is WIRED but UNPROVEN [★★★]

Built and wired ON 2026-08-31. Nothing here has seen a riscv64 build; it is all
source-read. **This is the highest-value thing the next media-riscv64 build can
settle.**

Mechanism, the full watch-list and the back-out procedure live in
[`gen1-riscv64-genai.md`](gen1-riscv64-genai.md) — that page owns them. What is
OPEN, i.e. what a build must still settle:

- **Does it compile, link and generate sane tokens on riscv64?** Seven things
  can bite, in a known order (compile → target python dev files → llguidance
  linking → `EXT_SUFFIX` → `-latomic` → performance → crates.io fetch). Token
  sanity is the one no gate here can prove: upstream #594 is a RISC-V build that
  compiled, imported and emitted nonsense, and smoke tiers 1-3 pass in that
  state. Arm tier 4 with `GENAI_MODEL_DIR`.
- **Did the `--use_guidance` preflight FIRE?** `60-build-genai.sh` drops the flag
  with only a WARN when rustup lacks the riscv64 std. The wheel then ships
  WITHOUT llguidance and is parity-divergent from amd64/arm64 — and NO gate can
  see it. Grep the riscv64 genai stage log for `dropping --use_guidance`; if it
  fired, fix `install-rust.sh`/`CROSS_TARGETS` and rebuild rather than shipping.
- **ARCH-PARITY is RED ON PURPOSE until that build lands** — every
  currently-shipped riscv64 image now fails the genai assertion. Do not "fix" it
  by re-adding the exemption.
- **Raise the riscv64 app-wheel floor 12 → 13 only after a real run PRINTS 13.**
  Raising a floor a run cannot reach reds the gate for the wrong reason.
- **The new `validate-media-runtime.sh` genai NEEDED scan has never run against
  a real image** on any arch. It is expected to be a no-op on amd64/arm64.

### A2. QNN-LINUX — fan-out validation, BLOCKED on the login-gated SDK

- **CORRECTED 2026-08-31 — three of the four fan-out flags were invented.** The
  wiring "mirrors Windows #121 exactly", and Windows #154 established that
  `TFLITE_ENABLE_QNN`, `USE_QNN` and `IREE_TARGET_BACKEND_QNN` are not upstream
  options: CMake drops an undeclared `-D` silently and exits 0, so all three logged
  success and did nothing. Only ORT's `onnxruntime_USE_QNN` was ever real. TVM and
  IREE have no Qualcomm path at all and their flags are gone. LiteRT's IS real but
  under a different name — `LITERT_ENABLE_QUALCOMM`, auto-forced ON by
  `QAIRT_HEADERS_DIR` — and this lane already configures the right tree (`litert/`),
  so it is now correctly wired for the first time.
  **A second defect fell out of the same reading, and it is live on every build:**
  `litert/vendors/CMakeLists.txt` `file(DOWNLOAD)`s QAIRT 2.47.0.260601 from
  softwarecenter.qualcomm.com whenever `QAIRT_HEADERS_DIR` is empty — ~1.5 GB, **no
  `EXPECTED_HASH`, no `STATUS` check**, and NOT gated on `LITERT_ENABLE_QUALCOMM`, so
  it fired on every LiteRT configure including builds that want no NPU. It cannot be
  dodged with a stub path (any non-empty value force-enables Qualcomm with headers we
  do not have), so `_litert_disable_qairt_header_download` short-circuits the guard
  when no SDK is staged. MediaTek's NeuroPilot fetch from AWS S3 and the Samsung
  LiteCore fetch are suppressed with stub header dirs — both gate on the header
  EXISTING, so a stub is safe there.
  **Still unvalidated by a build** — see below; this corrects the wiring, it
  does not prove it.

Wiring is LANDED and fail-safe (no zip = byte-identical behaviour on every arch,
validated by the 2026-08-30 media rebuilds). ORT was PROVEN on real QAIRT
v2.49.0.260730. What is unproven is the OPPOSITE direction: with a REAL zip
staged on arm64, do the two builds that really have a QNN path (ORT, LiteRT)
stay GREEN and do the staged libs land? That one run also answers LiteRT's
QNN-manager header fetch and the wheel-staging question.

**Owner action — smaller than previously written.** `QNN_SDK_LINUX_ZIP_SHA256`
is already IMPLEMENTED and POPULATED with the v2.49.0.260730 hash, so
re-staging **that exact version needs NO re-pin** — the existing hash validates
it and a mismatch means a different build was downloaded. Only a NEWER SDK needs
`sha256sum <zip>` + a versions.env update in the same commit. Steps: download
the Linux AArch64 SDK from qpm.qualcomm.com (Qualcomm ID + EULA), drop the zip
in `linux/qnn-sdk/`, rebuild media-arm64, remove the zip afterwards (README
discipline). `QNN_SDK_LINUX_LIBDIR` (default `aarch64-oe-linux-gcc11.2`) is the
single knob if a newer SDK renames the lib subdir. Corrected README: 2026-08-31.

## B. Flagged, deliberately NOT fixed (blast radius > value right now)

Found during the 2026-08-31 GEN1 review. The two RISK-REDUCING ones were fixed
the same day (see the archive); this is what deliberately remains.

- **The genai RUN in Dockerfile.media mounts no cargo registry/git cache** [S·★],
  so llguidance's crates are fetched from crates.io on every uncached build
  behind only `retry 3 10`. Already true for arm64, so fixing it changes that
  lane's cache behaviour — it is risk-NEUTRAL for correctness and would re-key
  the arm64 genai layer, which is why it was left out of the 2026-08-31 window.
  Note it if the riscv64 genai stage flakes on the network.

## C. Pre-existing, found while auditing 2026-08-31

- **`test-preflight-slugs.sh` feeds `comm` unsorted input** [S·★★] — every run
  prints `comm: file 1 is not in sorted order` (×2) and still reports
  `5 assertion(s) passed`. `comm` on unsorted input does not compute a correct
  set difference, so its `_missing` / `_orphan` assertions may be passing
  VACUOUSLY. Not touched by the 2026-08-31 window (the file is unmodified), but
  it is exactly the toothless-gate class standing rule 5 is about. Sort both
  inputs, then re-check that the assertions still pass for the right reason.

## E. Waiting on a TRIGGER (not on work)

- **PAR4-hard — true memory cap (MemoryHigh/jobserver)** — only if a
  divisor-6 parallel run OOMs again.
- **GCC_PARALLEL_TARGETS on a full push chain** — validated locally 2026-08-30
  (green, ~30 % GCC-RUN saving); the next full chain that wants the parallel
  GCC must pass `GCC_PARALLEL_TARGETS=1` on its command line (it now reaches
  the container — the plumbing fix 92fb9646).
- **gcc-prereq measurement facets** (sig-cache, LIBRARY_PATH leak, verify
  coverage, dup-compile overlap) — needs ccache stats from a real build;
  the "unify prereq paths" reading is CLOSED (deliberately different).
- **post-restart base cache-miss** — observe at the next host reboot.
- **LOG7 — sdkmanager CLI deprecated** — bit-rot watch before Google
  removes it.
- **MESON-GI — meson 1.12 breaks gobject-introspection's glib-subproject
  resolution (riscv64 cross gst)** [S·★, WATCH]. Pin in place:
  `setup-gstreamer.sh` installs `meson==1.11.2` for riscv64 cross only
  (amd64 native + arm64 no-introspection are fine on 1.12).
  **RE-PROBED 2026-08-31: still 1.12.0.** `git ls-remote mesonbuild/meson`
  shows no 1.12.x point release and no 1.13 — so no released meson fixes it yet
  and the pin stays. (Note: the repo pins `GOBJECT_INTROSPECTION_VERSION=1.86.0`;
  earlier notes here said "g-i 1.84", which was stale.) Retest by removing the
  pin in a closure window once meson moves.
- **NODE-RV — riscv64 ships Node v22 (pin: 26.8.1)** [S·★, WATCH].
  ubuntu-ports has no 26.x for riscv64; the install falls back fail-open with a
  WARN (by design, seen in every wave-4 smoke log).
  **RE-PROBED 2026-08-31: ports `resolute` (26.04) riscv64 universe still ships
  `nodejs 22.22.1+dfsg+~cs22.19.15-1ubuntu1`** — no 26.x, so the fallback stays
  correct. Re-check at each bump window.
  NB (2026-08-27): the pin moved 26.8.0 → 26.8.1 because the OFFICIAL v26.8.0
  tarball self-reports `26.8.0-alpha.0.0.0` and its own bundled npm then refuses
  it (semver puts a prerelease outside `>=22.9.0`). Re-check the REPORTED
  version, not just the tarball name, at every bump — the gate that missed it
  compared a PREFIX and has since been tightened to an exact match.
- **SV-residual — watch the first real `compose up`** — user-side.
- **riscv64 isa-spec smoke on real hardware** — needs hardware.
- **WEBUI_SECRET_KEY server-side rotation** — user action.
