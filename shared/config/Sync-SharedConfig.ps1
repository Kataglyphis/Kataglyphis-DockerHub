.SYNOPSIS
  Checks or refreshes a consumer's copies of the shared tool configs.

.DESCRIPTION
  See README.md next to this script for WHY these configs are copied into
  consumers rather than referenced: clang-format, clang-tidy and pre-commit
  discover their config by walking UP from the file being processed, so a config
  inside a submodule is never found - and dropping the local copy would silently
  disable format-on-save in every editor while CI kept passing.

  The copy therefore stays and this script makes drift impossible instead of
  unnoticed.

.PARAMETER RepoRoot
  Consumer repository root holding the local copies.

.PARAMETER Check
  Report differences and exit 1 if any. Default when neither switch is given.

.PARAMETER Write
  Overwrite the consumer's copies with the canonical ones.

.PARAMETER Ignore
  File names this project deliberately owns, e.g. -Ignore gcovr.cfg. Reported as
  skipped so an intentional exception never looks like drift.

.OUTPUTS
  Exit code 0 when in sync (or written), 1 when -Check found differences.

# argument arrives as a plain string: `-Ignore a,b,c` binds the whole thing as
# ONE element "a,b,c", which then matches no file name and the ignore silently
# does nothing. A consumer that legitimately owns several of these files would
# see its documented escape hatch fail with no explanation (found doing exactly
# that for AccelerANTgine, 2026-08-11). Splitting here makes -File
# and -Command behave the same.
