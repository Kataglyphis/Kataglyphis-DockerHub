# `Import-Module <repo module> -Force` inside a script that the build chain
# invokes IN-PROCESS is a delayed-action bug, and an expensive one.
#
# 2026-08-21, media-core/ONNX: the chain entrypoint imported
# WindowsSourceBuild.Common with -Force (module instance M1) and called
# Invoke-SourceBuildChain, which runs the leaf builders in-process
# (`& (Join-Path $ScriptDir $stage.Script)`). build-onnx-from-source.ps1 then
# did its own `Import-Module ... -Force`, which REMOVES M1 while
# Invoke-SourceBuildChain is still on the stack. ONNX compiled fine for 53
# minutes; the chain tail then died on
#   The term 'Stop-LingeringBuildProcess' is not recognized
# because that helper is deliberately UNEXPORTED and only ever lived in M1's
# scope. The exported call one line above it (Write-SccacheStats) still worked
# — it resolves through the global command table — which is exactly what makes
# this so confusing to read in a log.
#
# The repo already banned -Force for the nested imports INSIDE modules
# (2026-08-04). This extends the same rule to the scripts the chain invokes,
# which is where it actually bit.
